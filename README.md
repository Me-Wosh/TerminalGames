# Terminal Games

It was a fun project that helped me learn more about the ANSI/ASCII characters and terminal input/output manipulation. Besides that it was my first Ruby project so this way I could learn about its syntax, thought process behind the language and I could try something new.

# NOTE
Windows CMD and PowerShell aren't aware of the concept of getting user input without blocking the program so the games might not work properly. The easiest workaround is to run a second thread responsible only for user input.

# Space Invaders

### It features (I believe) all mechanics that the original game had, that is:
* Moving player character
* Shooting at enemies
* Enemies moving at intervals and shooting back at the player
* Special faster enemy that spawns once in a while and rewards bonus points if shot
* Shields that block both enemies and player bullets
* 3 lives that can regenerate if certain conditions are met
* Level ups
