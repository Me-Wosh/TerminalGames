# Terminal Games

## Space Invaders

It was a fun project that helped me learn more about the ANSI/ASCII characters and terminal input/output manipulation. Besides that it was my first Ruby project so this way I could learn about its syntax, thought process behind the language and to try something new.

It features (I believe) all mechanics that the original game had, that is:
* Moving player character
* Shooting at enemies
* Enemies moving at intervals and shooting back at the player
* Special faster enemy that spawns once in a while and rewards bonus points if shot
* Shields that block both enemies and player bullets
* 3 lives that can regenerate if certain conditions are met
* Level ups
